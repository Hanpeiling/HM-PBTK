AI empowered construction of a multi-species physiologically based toxicokinetic model

The high-throughput multi-species physiologically based toxicokinetic (HM-PBTK) allows you to predict the distribution of chemical concentrations in specific tissues in a wide range of fish species after exposure to chemicals in water.

To facilitate the use of the HM-PBTK model by risk assessors for simulating the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) processes of chemicals across multiple species and conducting the quantitative in vitro to in vivo extrapolation (QIVIVE) toxicity assessments, a user-friendly platform (www.ierp-dlut.cn) named Integrated Ecological Risk Predictions (IERP) has been established and is the first to provide ecological risk prediction based on PBTK models

By simply inputting species information (species name, species weight and length), chemical information, exposure scenarios (exposure time and dose, water temperature and pH), and in vitro toxicity data, IERP can provide a comprehensive chain service, including physiological and biochemical parameter prediction, HM-PBTK model construction, chemical ADME process analysis, and in vivo toxicity estimation.
